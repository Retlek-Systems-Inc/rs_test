Really Small Test Framework C
=============================

Introduction
------------

This module includes a simple test framework for environments where
printf debugging is not an option.

A run of tests consists of a Test Suite which may contain one or more
Test Cases. Each test case is in itâ€™s own function definition, where the
function name is the name of the test.

A common Startup, Teardown and Failure callback function may be defined
and associated with a TestSuite. \* The Startup function (if defined) is
executed before every test case. \* The Teardwon function (if defined)
is executed after every test case. \* The Failure function (if defined)
is executed only if a failure (ASSERT_TRUE(false) or
END_TESTCASE_FAIL()) are detected and executed.

There is a simpler functional execution where no monitoring occurs, and
the only means of detecting an error is if the abort handler, typically
and interrupt service routine, is executed.

Usage
-----

The intention is this is to be included as-is in a CMake C project and
statically linked. The intent is to hold the following design
requirements:

-  platform agnostic
-  minimal size
-  efficient as possible
-  use with embedded systems such as arm-none-eabi or other similar
   cross compilers
-  fully tested and confirmation of tests (TBD)
-  fully documented (Partial)

Documentation
-------------

TODO(phelter): get documentation running

Build Status
------------

Builds are done via actions - must enable ``-DRSTEST_BUILD_EXAMPLE=ON`` in cmake options for tests to run.
